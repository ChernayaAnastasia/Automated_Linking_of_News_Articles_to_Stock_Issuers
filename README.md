# Automated Linking of Telegram News to Stock Issuers Using NLP Techniques

This project focuses on automatically linking news from Telegram channels to stock issuers using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Data
Data were collected using Telegram API and Moscow Exchange API from 26 most popular Telegram channels aimed at
investors, specifically those with the highest number of subscribers. 

Then data were annotated (linked to stock issures (or company's tickers)) using rule-based approach: with Regular Expression and list of company's names ('synonyms', aliases).
